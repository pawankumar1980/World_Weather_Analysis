 ## Results
 
 ### Retrieve Weather Data
 
In this section, we have used API to pull the weather data of close to 700 cities worldwide. The data points include maximum temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, humidity and current weather description. This information makes it easy for travellers to choose what they want in a travel destination.

### Creation of Customer Travel Map for Vacation

In this section, we use the weather data information we retrieved earlier and Google Maps API to plot different travel destinations and hotel information at each location.

### Creation of a Travel Itinerary Map for Vacation

In this section, we have used Google directions API to create a travel itinerary. For example, the image below shows a four-stop itinerary in the North and West parts of India - Toda Raisingh, Anta, Dondaicha and Khed.

Also, as with the vacation search folder, each location has a piece of hotel information.
